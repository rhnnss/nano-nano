This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Linting

Before building the project, it's beneficial to run the linting command to catch and automatically fix style and formatting issues. This helps avoid common ESLint errors during the build process:

```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```

Example errors that can be automatically fixed:

```
32:32  Error: Replace `flex-col·w-ful` with `w-full·flex-co`  prettier/prettier
33:29  Error: Replace `px-1·py-2·mb-3` with `mb-3·px-1·py-2`  prettier/prettier
35:28  Error: Replace `w-[60px]·h` with `h-[60px]·w`  prettier/prettier
66:32  Error: Delete `Cr`  prettier/prettier
```
